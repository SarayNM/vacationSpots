# About
Ulun Danu Temple lies at the edge of Baratan Lake in Bedugul in Bali.

This pretty building is dedicated to the goddess of the lake and is one of the quietest and most serene places on the island.

Make sure to check out all the different shrines, each one dedicated to a different god, and look out for the ornate architectural touches such as the intricate carved gates.
